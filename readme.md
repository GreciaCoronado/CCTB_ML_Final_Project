This is a program to detect the language of texts using machine learning
We make use of the SK-learn libaray function multinominal regeression to achive this as we have based a data set with sevral languages all with 1000 words
There are limits to this however we can only achieve about 93% accuracy and then the program can only identify what languages has been given to it.
